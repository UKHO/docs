[Back to main Readme](README.md)

The Cloud First Approach is a strategic initiative aimed at prioritizing the adoption of cloud computing technologies in software engineering endeavors within the UK Hydrographic Office. This approach stems from the recognition of the transformative potential of cloud computing to enhance agility, innovation, and cost-effectiveness in delivering digital services.

## Guiding Principles

* Agility: Embrace cloud technologies to rapidly respond to changing business requirements and market dynamics.
* Security: Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and applications through robust security measures.
* Compliance: Adhere to relevant regulatory requirements and industry standards governing data privacy, security, and governance.
* Cost Optimization: Optimize cloud resources usage to maximize cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency.
* Innovation: Foster a culture of experimentation and innovation by leveraging cloud-native services and capabilities.
* Reliability: Ensures that workloads meet uptime and recovery targets by building redundancy and resiliency at scale.

In general, security concerns are expected to take precedence over other concerns.

## Benefits and Challenges

A Cloud First Approach offers numerous benefits, including:

* Enhanced scalability and flexibility
* Faster time to market for software solutions
* Improved collaboration and productivity
* Cost savings through pay-as-you-go pricing models

It also presents challenges such as:

* Security and compliance concerns
* Operational complexity during migration and integration
* Potential vendor lock-in risks
