## Statement on personal / sensitive data

Personal Identifiable Information (PII) should only be held in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018.

PII should be minimised and/or anonymised in system logging. Where PII is required in logs, the PII should be pseudonymised.

![Image shows pseudonymisation allows decryption to the original PII and anonymisation is irreversible PII manipulation](images/Difference-between-anonymization-and-pseudonymization.png)

## Data Protection Act and useful respources (Links)

## Georedundancy

Where possible, data should be georedundant. Some cloud services have this available out-of-the-box, such as Azure Storage Accounts, and others require setting up multiple resources and designating a primary and secondary.
