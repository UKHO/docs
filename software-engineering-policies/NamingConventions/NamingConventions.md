# Naming Conventions

## Overview

Where possible we want to use the same names for things that are common across many implementations, easier maintenance.

## Aim

To set out naming conventions that have been agreed between SE, DDC & Tech Ops and to apply them as consistently as possible. We do not intend to force retrofit on existing implementations. It is understood that there may be reasons for deviating from the conventions and we cannot cover all eventualities.

## Conventions

For security we have kept our naming convention documentation `internal` to prevent conventions from being used as a potential attack vector.

See [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/UKHO/docs-internal/blob/main/NamingConventions/NamingConventions.md).
