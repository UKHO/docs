## DRAFT Preview Items policy

## Purpose of policy

To give some guidance on considerations when a preview item is required on an Azure subscription.

## Before enabling a preview feaure
Decide upon the reason for enabling the feature:  There is a caveat with preview features - they may never go into GA , may be in preview for many months (or even years) and may be withdrawn.

In addition a preview feature may not have the same reliability or security standards of a GA feature.

## Enabling
A feature can be enabled (registered) by anyone on a subscription who has contributor or owner rights (or a custom role created just for the purpose).

Some features must be enabled by contacting Microsoft.

The feature should be enabled on Dev or Test subscription to begin with and then the functionality tested

If any adverse affects are seen , it should be removed (unregistered).

If the functionality does not meet the requirements it should be removed (unregistered).

The preview feature can then be enabled in QA if needed and further tested.

If the feature is to be enabled in a Production or Live environment, best practice would dictate there should be a Change Request.
After this the feature can be enabled in Live/Production.

## Removing and risk of continuing to use
If after assessment of the preview feature, it does not meet the requirements, it should be unregistered from all affected subscriptions.

If the requirements are met it should be noted that to adopt any service which depends on the preview feature could be a risk.

A provisioned service which depends on a preview feature could cease to function after a period of time.

It is highly recommended not to adopt any Azure preview feature in any production or live environment until it has been designated as GA by Microsoft.  If there is a business need to do it, it should be approved by senior management (tbc).

## Monitoring

It is not possible to centrally monitor enabled preview features.  Therefore the responsibility for removing the feature should lie with the developer/staff member who enabled it.
