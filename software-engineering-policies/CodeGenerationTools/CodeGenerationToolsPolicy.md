# Use of Code Generation Tools

## Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines and responsibilities for the use of code generation tools by colleagues within the UK Hydrographic Office. Its purpose is to maximize productivity and innovation while safeguarding data security, intellectual property, legal compliance, and code quality.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party users who utilize code generation tools, including but not limited to tools that offer AI-assisted code completion, generation, or modification in any development environment across the organization.

## Data Security and Confidentiality

* Data Handling: Users must ensure that any adopted tools do not inadvertently share with external services sensitive, classified, or personally identifiable information (PII) during code generation.

* Transmission and Storage: All interactions with adopted code generation tools should comply with the organization’s encryption and data residency policies, ensuring that any data transmitted is securely handled.

* Compliance: The use of adopted tools must be aligned with all internal and external information security requirements, including those applicable to cloud-hosted environments.

## Intellectual Property and Licensing

* Ownership: The UK Hydrographic Office retains ownership of the codebase. Users must understand how generated code is integrated, ensuring that no third-party intellectual property rights are inadvertently compromised.

* Licensing Compatibility: All outputs produced by code generation tools should be verified for licensing compliance. Generated code must not introduce code snippets that conflict with the organization’s licensing policies.

* Review: Generated code should be treated as a draft and subject to full review before integration, ensuring alignment with the organization’s IP and licensing standards.

## Legal and Regulatory Compliance

* Regulatory Alignment: Usage of code generation tools must comply with all relevant local, national, and international regulations, including data protection laws (e.g., GDPR) and government-specific compliance requirements.

* Auditability: Tools and processes should be implemented to track and log the use of code generation technologies, ensuring that activities can be audited for compliance with legal and regulatory standards.

## Code Quality and Review Process

* Human Oversight: Code generated by these tools must undergo the same review, testing, and quality assurance processes as manually written code.

* Integration: Developers should integrate the output from code generation tools into the existing codebase only after thorough review and necessary modifications.

* Continuous Improvement: Feedback on generated code should be documented to continuously improve tool usage and integration practices.

## Training and Best Practices

* Training: Training programs should be provided for all relevant roles, including software engineers (junior to principal), DevOps, and Data Engineers. Training should cover the effective use of these tools and adherence to this policy.

* Best Practices: Documentation and guidelines outlining best practices for using code generation tools should be maintained and updated regularly. Users should be encouraged to share feedback and lessons learned.

* Ongoing Education: Updates and refresher sessions should be conducted to keep all users informed about changes in the tools, best practices, and policy updates.

## Operational Integration and Monitoring

* Tool Compatibility: Adopted tools should be evaluated to ensure that they integrate effectively with the existing technology stack, workflows, and cloud environments.

* Usage Monitoring: Monitoring the utilization of these tools should be available to identify any deviations or potential misuse.

* Usage Restrictions: Appropriate usage limits and access controls must be available  for scenarios involving particularly sensitive or critical code to mitigate associated risks.

## Risk Management

* Risk Assessment: Regularly assess risks associated with the use of code generation tools, including the potential for introducing vulnerabilities or unlicensed code.

* Review Cycle: The policy and associated practices should be reviewed periodically to reflect evolving technology, regulatory changes, and emerging best practices.

## Transparency and Accountability

* Feedback Mechanism: A feedback loop should be established, enabling users to report problematic outputs or suggest improvements. This information will be used to refine both tool usage guidelines and the policy itself.

* Responsibility: Each user is responsible for ensuring that the generated code complies with this policy and does not compromise the organization’s security or quality standards.
