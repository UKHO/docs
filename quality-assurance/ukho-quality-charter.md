# UKHO Delivery Quality Charter

This is the UKHO Delivery Quality Charter - a set of objectives that will improve how teams can quality assure their software.

## The Team

* All members of the team are equal â€“ there should be no differences between developers and testers in:   
    * Permissions they have been assigned (e.g. permissions to access environments).
    * Access to hardware or software.
    * Weight of opinion.
* Teams that are multi-disciplinary, cross-functional and equal achieve better results.

## Ways of Working

* Planning, creating and executing tests (including manual testing) is the responsibility of **everyone** in the team.
* The role of the tester in the team is to **champion** quality assurance and testing at **all** stages of the development process.
* The tester ensures that a test approach is created and agreed with an appropriate set of stakeholders.  The whole delivery team is responsible for the quality of the test approach, and for carrying it out.
* The tester ensures that information about testing is gathered into a Test Summary Report (TSR), and that it is reviewed by an appropriate set of stakeholders.  The tester must ensure that all members of the team that have contributed to development understand the testing and agree with the conclusion of the TSR.
* Test approaches should reflect the [UKHO Test Strategy](test-strategy.md), with appropriate levels of automated, manual and non-functional testing.


## Acceptance Criteria

* Every story will have acceptance criteria added before being worked on.
* Acceptance criteria will not be changed without cross-team awareness.
* Acceptance criteria will be testable, i.e. capable of being proven true or false.
* Testers should champion the use of good quality acceptance criteria.
