This page documents the production and review of Test Approach / Test Summary Report (TA-TSR) documents.

## When is the document modified

The test approach section of the document is completed early in the project, ideally before or at the beginning of the build phase.

The test summary section is completed as a pre-requisite for the software going live, or for project closure if the software is not going live.

## Responsible person for producing the TA-TSR

A team's tester is responsible for producing the document.  However, the responsibility for testing the product properly sits with the whole delivery team.  The TA-TSR should therefore reflect the whole team's opinion and requires their input and sign-off. 

## When to produce a Test Approach / Test Summary Report

Not all deliveries require a TA-TSR.

It is required when:

- the release is going to be considered by CAB; 
- new software is being created;
- no established testing practice exists for it;
- if the tester wishes to communicate the test approach / results to stakeholders, e.g. if the software is high profile or the release risky.

It is not required if the testing is going to follow a established practices, e.g. a simple maintenance release will typically not require one.

## Reviewing the TA-TSR

The tester is responsible for identifying people who can provide expertise to the review and for naming them as reviewers.  The reviewers for the Test Approach section and for the Test Summary Report section need not be the same, but often will be. The following people will always be reviewers:

- Test Lead;
- Lead Developer;
- Product Owner, Service Owner or equivalent;
- Delivery Manager or equivalent.

## Document Storage

A copy of every completed TSR should be stored in a central location on SharePoint.

## Test Lead responsibility

In reviewing these documents a Test Lead is assuring the following:

## Test Approach

- Has the form been completed as far as possible? 
- Is the approach in line with the test policies? 
- Has the approach been agreed with appropriate people? 
- Does the tester need support from outside the team?

## Test Summary Report

- Has the testing been done according to the agreed approach? 
- Have appropriate people reviewed the testing (from the team and other SMEs)? 
- Is testing recorded, outstanding risks and defects approved etc.? 
- Is testware usable in future work?

Test Leads do not review individual tests.  They are not experts in the system so canâ€™t take a detailed view on coverage.  They also do not make the decision to go live; the document provides key evidence to inform that decision.
