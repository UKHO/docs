# Web Accessibility Testing

## Quick link - how to test for accessibility

To learn how to test accessibility in your project read the [UKHO web accessibility testing](web-accessibility-testing.md) page.

## What is accessibility

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web.  It encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the web, including

* auditory
* cognitive
* neurological
* physical
* speech
* visual

Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, like older people with changing abilities due to ageing and people with “temporary disabilities” such as

* a broken arm
* lost glasses
* people using a slow Internet connection
* people who have limited or expensive bandwidth

## Legal requirements

The accessibility regulations came into force for public sector bodies on 23 September 2018. They say you must make your website or mobile app more accessible by making it ‘perceivable, operable, understandable and robust’. You need to include and update an accessibility statement on your website.

The full name of the accessibility regulations is the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

The accessibility regulations build on your existing obligations to people who have a disability under the Equality Act 2010 (or the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in Northern Ireland). These say that all UK service providers must consider ‘reasonable adjustments’ for disabled people.

## WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (known as WCAG 2.1) are an internationally recognised set of recommendations for improving web accessibility.

WCAG 2.1 is based on 4 design principles:

* perceivable
* operable
* understandable
* robust

It is the WCAG recommendations that are used to verify whether a website or mobile app is accessible.

## Developing your service for accessibility

Read [how to make your service accessible](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction) throughout the development and maintainance of your service.

To learn how to test accessibility in your project read the [UKHO web accessibility testing](web-accesibility-testing.md) page.

## Incorporating accessibility testing into the Definition of Done

We can’t deploy code which is not accessible so if it’s not accessible it’s not done. Including accessibility in your team's Definition of Done is a great way to ensure the requirements are met.

Accessibility considerations to be included in a Definition of Done include:

* Code quality
* Usability
* Screen readers
* Screen magnifiers
* Voice control

See [a detailed example definition of done](https://github.com/hmrc/accessibility/blob/master/docs/definition-of-done.md) that contains examples of these.

## Accessibility Statement

You must produce a bespoke accessibility statement for your service that details how accessible it is and any areas that aren't. See an example UK Government (Universal Credit) [accessibility statement](https://www.universal-credit.service.gov.uk/accessibility-statement).

Read more about [publishing your accessibility statement](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement#publish-your-accessibility-statement).

The gov.uk resource also have a [template accessibility statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website) and there is also an [accessibility statement generator](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/generator/#create) that can be used.

## Recording testing evidence

It is important to keep evidence of all the accessibility testing. This means at any point you have an understanding of how accessible your service is. It also means you know when you are ready for a full audit, it is unlikely you will find any major issues when doing so.
